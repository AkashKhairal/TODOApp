**Project: Simple Todo List**
**Objectives:**

**1. Learning Basic Java Syntax:**

Utilize fundamental Java syntax, including variables, data types, loops, and conditional statements.
Demonstrate an understanding of Java console input and output.

**2. Working with Arrays or ArrayLists:**

Implement a mechanism for storing and managing tasks using either arrays or ArrayLists.

**3. Creating a Menu-Driven Interface:**

Design a menu-driven interface that allows users to add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks.

**4. Task Representation:**

Define a Task class with attributes such as title, description, and status (pending/completed).

**5. Basic Error Handling:**

Implement basic error handling to handle invalid user inputs.

**Functional Requirements:**

**1. Add Task:**

Users can add a new task to the Todo List. Each task should have a unique identifier, a title, a description, and an initial status of "pending."

**2. View Tasks:**

Users can view all tasks in the Todo List, including their titles, descriptions, and statuses.

**3. Mark Task as Completed:**

Users can mark a task as completed, changing its status from "pending" to "completed."

**4. Remove Task:**

Users can remove a task from the Todo List.

**5. Error Handling:**

Implement basic error handling to handle cases where the user provides invalid input (e.g., selecting an option that doesn't exist).
