**Project: Simple Todo List**
Objectives:
Learning Basic Java Syntax:

Utilize fundamental Java syntax, including variables, data types, loops, and conditional statements.
Demonstrate an understanding of Java console input and output.
Working with Arrays or ArrayLists:

Implement a mechanism for storing and managing tasks using either arrays or ArrayLists.
Creating a Menu-Driven Interface:

Design a menu-driven interface that allows users to add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks.
Task Representation:

Define a Task class with attributes such as title, description, and status (pending/completed).
Basic Error Handling:

Implement basic error handling to handle invalid user inputs.
Functional Requirements:
Add Task:

Users can add a new task to the Todo List. Each task should have a unique identifier, a title, a description, and an initial status of "pending."
View Tasks:

Users can view all tasks in the Todo List, including their titles, descriptions, and statuses.
Mark Task as Completed:

Users can mark a task as completed, changing its status from "pending" to "completed."
Remove Task:

Users can remove a task from the Todo List.
Error Handling:

Implement basic error handling to handle cases where the user provides invalid input (e.g., selecting an option that doesn't exist).
